mitmweb
=======

**mitmweb** is mitmproxy's web-based user interface that allows interactive
examination and modification of HTTP traffic. Like mitmproxy, it differs from
mitmdump in that all flows are kept in memory, which means that it's intended
for taking and manipulating small-ish samples.

.. warning::

  Mitmweb is currently in beta. We consider it stable for all features currently
  exposed in the UI, but it still misses a lot of mitmproxy's features.
